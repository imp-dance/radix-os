# Community

If you have make and publish applications for use with Radix OS, make sure to reach out through Github so that we can feature your applications here.

To submit your own application, click the edit link below.

# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, whether it's documentation, feature requests or code.

To contribute to code, you should first [submit an issue](https://github.com/imp-dance/radix-os/issues/new) (and then optionally create a pull request).

## Workflow for local development

After pulling the repository, run `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` in the root directory. The dev server will import the code directly from the `packages/radix-os` folder so you can edit the package files and have hot reloading for the demo app.
