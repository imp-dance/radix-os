# Customization

You can pass a couple of options directly to the `RadixOS` component to customize the Radix theme:

- `accentColor`: The preferred accent color of the Radix theme
- `radius`: The preferred radius of the Radix theme

Beyond that, the settings app (and hook) allows you to set if _translucency_ is enabled, the preferred desktop background and dark mode.
